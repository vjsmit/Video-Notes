echo -n Hi
##This will print Hi in same line


Usual operations we do on a file ( 560 - ):
1) Modify the existing content
2) Add lines
3) Delete lines

Modify: 
 Search for the word with s(substitute cmd) and replace it:
    sed -i -e 's|/bash|/csh|' passwd  ##Here wherever we have /bash it will be replaced by /csh in passwd file
 
 To change complete line with c(change cmd):
    sed -i -e '<line#> c <content to add>' <file_name>
    sed -i -e '1 c SMIT' passwd   ## 1 is the line no. to be changed and SMIT is the content we want 
    
 To delete the line with d(delete cmd):
    sed -i -e '<line#> d' <file_name>
    sed -i -e '1 d' passwd
    
 To add the line with a(add cmd):
    sed -i -e '<line#> a <content to add>' <file_name>
    sed -i -e '0 a SAMPLE' passwd
 For last line addition we use $
    sed -i -e '$ a SAMPLE' passwd
 Insert with i
     sed -i -e '$ i NEW' passwd ##Here, we are inserting 'NEW' before the last line   
 
    
Loops: (01:06:00 - )

While loop will execute the same command again and again
i=0
while [ $i -lt 10 ]; do
    echo Hello from $i
    sleep 1
    i=$(($i+1))

done

for-loop:
 It is being controlled by no. of values

for i in httpd java nginx mariadb ; do
    echo "Installing $i package"
    sleep 1
done
