echo -n Hi
##This will print Hi in same line


Usual operations we do on a file ( 560 - ):
1) Modify the existing content
2) Add lines
3) Delete lines

Modify: 
    sed -i -e 's|/bash|/csh|' passwd  ##Here wherever we have /bash it will be replaced by /csh in passwd file
 To change complete line:
    sed -i -e '<line#> c <content to add>' <file_name>
    sed -i -e '1 c SMIT' passwd   ## 1 is the line no. to be changed and SMIT is the content we want
