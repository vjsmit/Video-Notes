She-Bang (07:00 - 17:00)

#! has to be in the very first line.
If she-bang(#!) is in second line or any where else then it is treated as a comment.
Usually it is a best practice to start a script with She-Bang.

Comments

Any line starting with # character is treated a Comment.
Generally comments are ignored by your interpreter.
Usually comments are used to make a comment for future reference for self or others as well.

# or #### (n#) is also treated as comment.


Permission (18:30 - 30:00)

Every file has owner and group owner
chown/chgrp : to change owner of the group
        $ sudo chown root <file_name>   #Now, the file is owned by root user
        $ sudo chgrp root <file_name>   #Now, group owner is changed to root
        $ sudo chown root:root <file_name> #Now, both group and file owner changed to root
        
        
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 25 Aug 27 05:38 1.sh
 We have 3 blocks here:
 
 rw- : owner(u)
 r-- : group owner (g)
 r-- : others (o)
 
 r - read
 w - write
 x - execute
 
 Here, owner can read and write.
       All other users inside this group can read only.
       Others have also read only access

To change permissions, we use chmod and +/- :

If we are owner of file we can change its permission and if we are not owner we need root permission to change the permissions.

chmod u+x <file_name>  #It will give user executable permissions
chmod u-x <file_name>  #It will remove user executable permissions
chmod ugo+rwx <file_name> #It will give read,write,executable permissions to all owner/ group and others.

.  = present directory
./ = In this directory

./<file_name>  #To execute the file

If we are damn sure that its shell script file, then,
sh <file_name.sh>

Permission applied to directory(40:30)
we can use same chmod/chmod with -R
