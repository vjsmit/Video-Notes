Ansible is a configuration mgt tool

Declarative vs Imperative:
  - Being declarative means you focus on the what instead of the how. 
  - An example would be you state that a service should be in a state of running.
  - Imperative: everything we have to take care

Why Ansible (15:00--)

Diff bw config mgmt tools (24:45--)
  - client needed bcoz in pull mechanism, nodes go to cmt to fetch the config. Hence they need agent software to connect
    but in ansible it uses ssh which is enabled by default.
  - Changes are not overwritten in Ansible bcoz once its push the confign, it's done. So if any web server crashes or stopped Ansible 
    will not be aware of it.
    But it can be overcome by pull approach
    but in chef/puppet nodes always pulls the confign from them with fixed freqn(default 30 mins). So, every 30 mins they will go to cmt 
    and pull the confign.
    
 How SSH Works (36:00--45:30)
      1) Client tried to connect the ip/hostname which we have given.
      2) Server offers its identity. (fingerprint)
      3) Client looks for identity locally if not asks you for storing it.
      4) Client offers local keys (default private keys) by default
      5) Server accepts the key and looks in authorized keys of user and looks for whether it is allowed to connect or not.
      6) If keys is accepted then session will be provided to client
      7) If not, then it looks for password authentication is enabled if enabled then it will ask you the password other wise the session is terminated.
      8) If password is allowed then it validates the password.



 
 Ansible Installation (45:32--58:00)
   - we usually install ansible on Jumpserver
   - Yum based installaion
      - $sudo yum list all | grep ansible
      - $sudo yum install ansible -y
   - Python based installation (using pip cmd)
     - ansible is a python module, it uses python in background 
     - $sudo yum install python2-pip -y
     - $sudo pip install ansible --upgrade (to get the latest version of ansible)
     
   - To check ansible version
       - $ansible --version
       
Ansible Inventory file (59:00--01:13:00)
  - All nodes info should be inside AIF
  - Its a plain text file with the list of node
  - Default group is 'All'
  - To see the list of host ansible is picking:
     - $ansible -i hosts all --list-hosts
  - We can make group of host
    - e.g. [group_name]
            node_name1
            node_name2
     -$ansible -i hosts group_name --list-hosts
  - hosts (node) can be part of multiple groups
  - we can make group of groups as well using keyword Children and inside that we have to give groups detail
     - [group_name:children]    
        group1
        group2
  - To empty the inventory files:
     - $>hosts  
        
        
Ansible Ad HOC command (01:16--)
  -shell is a module to run shell cmd like uptime cmd
     - $ansible -i hosts all -m shell -a uptime
     
  -Disable the fingerprint in ansible or to accept any fingerprint by using a config file or shell variables
      - $export ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING=False
      
  - u <user_name> and using -k to ask for pwd
  -ansible -i hosts all -u root -k -m shell -a uptime
