(1) Print (01:41 -- 07:00)
(2) Vars (07:00 -- )
(3) Vars_prompt (18:00)
(4) How to get variables from files (20:30 --)
(5) Sometimes we need to pass a variable as an argument i.e. vars from cli (26:00)
     - from cli we need to pass a variable by using -e option
         e.g. $ ansible-playbook playbooks/7-vars-from-cli.yml -e URL=cli.google.com
(6) Putting vars in inventory files (32:00)
      e.g. [all:vars]
           URL=group.google.com
     - best practice is to maintain a file
         group_files->all.yml
         
(7) Default variables (35:00 --)
      - to give ssh pwd in group_files
      - ansible_password: (not a good practice to )
      
(8) register variables (38:00 --)
         - to register a variable from o/p of one task and storing that output in a variable
         - register: var_name
         
(9) Define a variable in a task (45:00 --)
       set_fact:
         var_name: "{{}}"
         
(10) Task [Gathering Facts]  (47:00 --)
       - setup module
          - it connect to the node and gather all it's system  information as a variables 
          - e.g. ansible_machine:
          - gather_facts: no ====> then it will not gather facts about the node, By default it is set to yes
           
 Modules:
 (1) To print
     debug:
       msg:
 (2) Variable
       vars:
         var_name:
    
 (3) To ask i/p from user
        vars_prompt:
          prompt:
          name: var_name
          private: no (to view the input from user we have to give no)
          
 (4) Variable from files
        vars_files:
          - file location
   
 (5) Define variable in a task
        set_fact:
        var_name: "{{}}"
        
  (6) Setup
