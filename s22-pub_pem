(1) Privare key (06:00 --)
      - .pem file/ .pub file
      - .pub file we keep in amazon or we can upload it directly on server
      - one key pair is enough for one user.
      - Generate keypair:
         $ ssh-keygen -f devops
           - it will generate two files (1)devops.pub (2)devops
           - devops files we rename to devops.pem by $ mv devops devops.pem
           - usually we need to load this file with putty and covert the file to PPK in order to connect server with putty
      - connecting ubuntu server from git bash
         $ ssh -i devops.pem -l ubuntu <ip address>
         
      - connect to putty using key (25:20 -- )
         - open putty gen--->load our pem file--->save private key as ppk file
         - Now we open putty and in ssh-->auth we upload pem file
         
      - uploading the key manually to already running servers (28:00 -- )
         - earlier pub key was given to server by aws in /.ssh/authorized_keys
         - we have to go in .ssh file and cat authorised_keys. We have to add our pub key using vim editor
         
     - We have to connect to nodes from our workstation
        - so we have to upload .pem file in our ws
        - vi devops.pem and paste the .pem file here. This file shouldnt have permission more than 600 (i.e only rw)
        - now we can connect to the node from ws using $ ssh -i devops.pem -l centos <ip addr>
        
     - we shouldnt keep our devops.pem file in repository
     
  - roles continued (43:30)
  - Installing WebServer & AppServer (47:00 -- )
  - Jenkins (50:00)
     - jekins server should have ansible installed. 
     - shell script to install jenkins (54:00)


    Doubts
    (46:00) why ansible_distribution is only giving Ubuntu
