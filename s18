Ansible is a configuration mgt tool
Declarative vs Imperative:
  - Being declarative means you focus on the what instead of the how. 
  - An example would be you state that a service should be in a state of running.
  - Imperative: everything we have to take care

Why Ansible (15:00--)
Diff bw config mgmt tools (24:45--)
  - client needed bcoz in pull mechanism, nodes go to cmt to fetch the config. Hence they need agent software to connect
    but in ansible it uses ssh which is enabled by default.
  - Changes are not overwritten in Ansible bcoz once its push the confign, it's done. So if any web server crashes or stopped Ansible 
    will not be aware of it.
    But it can be overcome by pull approach
    but in chef/puppet nodes always pulls the confign from them with fixed freqn(default 30 mins). So, every 30 mins they will go to cmt 
    and pull the confign
