git command over cli (-- 20:00)

Cloning a repository:
 - git clone <URL> 
 
To see the files which has been not tracked or commit
 - git status
 
To add file to commit
 - git add <file_name>
 - git add -A (to commit all the files)
 
While commit we have to give some msg
 - git commit -m 'Type your msg here'
 
to push the changes to default branch master. And if already in master no need to mention it
 - git push origin master
 
 
 When we have to create our own branch:
 
 To see all the branches:
  - git branch -a
  
To create branch
 - git branch <branch_name>
 
All the commit can be checked using:
 - git log
 
Whichever commit we are in it will try to use that commit code and from that point it will try to create a branch

To go back from one commit to other
 - git checkout <commit id>  (evey commit has commit id)
 
Merge the code in master
 - git merge <branch_name>
