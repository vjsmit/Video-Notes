  - pipeline script from SCM (we need to create git repo and keeping the jobs inside that)
To create a job with the code
  - jenkin seed jobs: seed job is a Jenkins job which runs a DSL scripts, and then generates a new job
  
# In-process script approval (25:00)
   - Allows jenkinsadmin to  review proposed scripts (e.g. written in groovy) which run inside jenkin process
  
# Whenever we create a jenkins instance, we need to have a seed job created and run it. 
  All the jobs whichever are there we get it as per our requirement
  
 # Through the code we added the job and if we remove the code and that job will not be removed
    Action for removed jobs is by deafault: ignore 
     we can set it to delete
