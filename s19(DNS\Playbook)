(1) DNS Entry/DNS name (--33:00)
(2) Changing some default ansible config (34:00 - )
    - Default ansible config is available in /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg (we can copy it to current location using cp /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg .)
    - Ansible always first looks for config file locally if it's not there then it will use the cental one
    - To check config file location
        - $ansible --version
    - We can enable host_key_checking as false in order to disable fingerprint checking. (earlier we were usimg export variable)
    - We can change inventory location from "/etc/ansible/hosts" to "/home/centos/hosts". So, we dont have to give "-i hosts". Ansible will oick the host file.
    - We can uncomment remote_user = root. So, we can remove -u root also.
    - We can uncomment ask_pass = true. Then no need to give -k option.
    - $ansible -i hosts all -u root -k -m shell -a uptime =======> $ansible all -m shell -a uptime
