# ls -ld /opt /opt1 >/tmp/out 2>/tmp/err        

        command o/p in /tmp/out
        error o/p   in /tmp/err
  
 To save both command and error in same location:
 
          ls -ld /opt /opt1 &>/tmp/out
          
  When we dont want to save o/p and error then we redirect it in /dev/null        
  
           ls -ld /opt &>/dev/null
           
           

# Any command we execute is going to send the exit status to the shell and from that status we can validate whether the command is sucessfully executed or not.

## Exit status is a number 

# Exit states ranges from 0-255

# 0 is globally successful 
# 1-255 is a failure or partially failure or partialy successful 


# As a author of a your own shell scripts you can use the exit status from 1-125
# 125+ are used by system and it is not preferred to use by the user.

## You can send your own exit status by using exit command 

exit 5
