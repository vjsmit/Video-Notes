file type 
1. ordinary file: Data, text, Program instruction
2. special file: All devices we genrally have in linux os, either its directly attached device or plug and play device all these are considered as file in linux os
                 All stored in /dev dir.
                 Files provide access to hw such as hard drives, CD-ROM drives, modems and ethernet adapters
3. directories: Store both ordinary and special files


command :
pwd - present working directories

ls - list of all files

flag for ls :
ls -l  : long list 
permission | memoery block | user |  group | memory of file in byte | date nd time | file name 
ll : long list 
ls -a : hidden file list

Create a file:
(1) cat>file_name : To create a file and add content in it.
                  : To save the file ctrl+d
(2) toch file_name : To create an empty file

Copy/Move/Rename the file:

mv: can be used to rename or move(cut-paste) files in same or diff location.
  : It cuts the file and paste it in same/another location with diff name.
  
cp: to copy file in same or another location.


Check content in the file:
cat- To check content
wc- To count word/letters in a file
 -c, --bytes            print the byte counts
 -m, --chars            print the character counts
 -l, --lines            print the newline counts
     --files0-from=F    read input from the files specified by
                           NUL-terminated names in file F;
                           If F is - then read names from standard input
 -L, --max-line-length  print the length of the longest line
 -w, --words            print the word counts
     --help     display this help and exit
     --version  output version information and exit

wc -c <file_name>


Delete the file:

rm <file_name>
rm <file1> <file2> <file3>
rm * (To delete all the file)
Syntax: rm file-name
• Example: rm sample
• Some times it may ask for a prompt (yes/no) to remove the files
which may require to parse –f option to not prompt it.


Linux in-built Files:

1> stdin - This is std file which takes the i/p.
2> stdout - For giving the o/p
3> stderr - This file is called when there is error

Directory commands:
cd for change directory
mkdir: to create a directory
ls –la : get detail info with hidden files/dir
dot(.) – current working directory
double dot (..) – Level above (immediate parent directory)
dot & double dot by default gets created when we create a directory
To make a dir with a space in bw:  
e.g. imp data, we use ‘\’ bw two word and a space.  
If we don’t give ‘\’ the it will create 2 diff directory.
To copy dir we use -r:
Cp –r <Dir1> <Dir2>

To delete dir:
rm –r <dir_name>  (to skip y/n, use -f option. e.g. rm -rf <dir_name>)
rmdir <file name> (To delete empty dir)

We can get the help of any command by using man pages.


to create directories one in another:
mkdir -p sample/one/two/three

Here, we are creating sample dir, inside that one dir, inside that one dir, inside that two dir, inside that three dir


cat -n <file_name>  --to print the file content with line#
head <file_name>    --to print top 10 lines
head -n 5 <file_name> --to print top 5 lines
tail <file_name>     -- to print last 10 lines
tail -n 5 <file_name> -- to print last 5 lines
tail -f <file_name>  -- to see the logs. -f is for follow up

grep cmd:
to print the lines which have that oarticular word.

grep word <file_name>  

It will print only the lines which have particular word

column based filtering: awk cmd
awk -F 'Delimiter' '{print $column-no.}' <file_name>
awk -F : '{print $NF}' passwd
