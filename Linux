ls - list of all files

flag for ls :
ls -l  : long list 
permission | memoery block | user |  group | memory of file in byte | date nd time | file name

cp: to copy file in same or another location.


Check content in the file:
cat- To check content
wc- To count word/letters in a file
 -c, --bytes            print the byte counts
 -m, --chars            print the character counts
 -l, --lines            print the newline counts
     --files0-from=F    read input from the files specified by
                           NUL-terminated names in file F;
                           If F is - then read names from standard input
 -L, --max-line-length  print the length of the longest line
 -w, --words            print the word counts
     --help     display this help and exit
     --version  output version information and exit

wc -c <file_name>


Delete the file:

rm <file_name>
rm <file1> <file2> <file3>
rm * (To delete all the file)
Syntax: rm file-name
• Example: rm sample
• Some times it may ask for a prompt (yes/no) to remove the files
which may require to parse –f option to not prompt it.


Linux in-built Files:

1> stdin - This is std file which takes the i/p.
2> stdout - For giving the o/p
3> stderr - This file is called when there is error

Directory commands:
cd for change directory
mkdir: to create a directory
ls –la : get detail info with hidden files/dir
dot(.) – current working directory
double dot (..) – Level above (immediate parent directory)
dot & double dot by default gets created when we create a directory
To make a dir with a space in bw:  
e.g. imp data, we use ‘\’ bw two word and a space.  
If we don’t give ‘\’ the it will create 2 diff directory.
To copy dir we use -r:
Cp –r <Dir1> <Dir2>

To delete dir:
rm –r <dir_name>

We can get the help of any command by using man pages.
