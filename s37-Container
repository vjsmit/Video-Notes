Docker is to run the container from the images.
All the images are pre-defined and available at hub.docker.com
Installing a container:
  from docs.docker.com
$ docker ps - It will show all the docker running comtainers
ps cmd - It will show the running process
If we want to run some service on container, we have to provide image
  $ docker run -d httpd
   - Here, we are running httpd. -d option to run in background
   
 Every, container will have internal ip add bcoz its like a virtual machine
 $ docker inspect <container id>
 $ curl ipconfig.co - to get the public ip add of the machine
 $ docker run -p 80:80 httpd
 80 port is open for container and not for the machine. So, whatever container we run we have to expose to the outside world
 -p otion is to publish the port, 80 port of my host machine to my container port 80. Its like mapping host port no. to my container port no.
