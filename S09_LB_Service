Replacing db server with db service provided by AWS.

RDS: It provide nosql db as a service

Using Web and App on single server.

LB: To balance the load bw servers
    using nginx as LB
    Using AWS LB service
    
    
 Services we should use a normal user not as a root user
 
15:00  We have to start webservice as a root user
       To open port#80, it uses root user service
       Any port bw 0 -1023 ports can only be opened by root user. Other user cant open these port no. (maybe due to security perspective) 
       
       
Classic LB
Application LB

Enhancement on Developer's idea:
1) USe LB
2) Use web and app om 1 server
3) Tomcat startup scripts with systemctl
4) RDS
