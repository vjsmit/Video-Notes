=>Ansible pull
  - node will pull config from ansible
  - need to install ansible and git package on node using $ sudo yum install ansible git -y
  - we have to use https link for pull from git
  - we have to use -U option to give URL of git   (URL of the playbook repository)
  - ansible-pull -U <URL>
    - It will look for playbook to run in intenal.yml file then local
  - Ansible pull has to be in git repository 
     
=>Ansible Tower - Its a UI 

=>Monitoring of nodes
  - Newrelic
  
  Doubt:
