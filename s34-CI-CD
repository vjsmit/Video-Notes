Branch and strategies:
(1) All code going to master branch
(2) Feature branch: If we want to release a feature we will will create one branch for that. Then it goes to master
(3) Sprint branching: every sprint we will create one branch. At the end of the sprint it goes to master.
(4) Story based branching: For every story we will have one branch. At end of story we can merged it into where ever we want to

In jira we will have epics--->stories--->tasks
