Purpose of Web Server:

1) To serve static content
2) Serves as a Gateway
3) Works as LB
4) WebHosting: Inside WS we can host multiple websites (Name based virtual hosting)
5) Reverse Proxy: Application is never exposed to outside world

What happens when we hit google.com:

1) What is ip add of url.
2) First it looks in local host file.
3) Second, it asks for DNS server.


Need to add server block for name based virtual hosting in the location /usr/local/nginx/conf/nginx.conf:
server {  
    listen       80;  
    server_name  app1.example.com;
    access_log  logs/app1-access.log;  
    error_log   logs/app1-error.log error; 
        root   html/app1;  
        index  index.html;  
}
After adding server block need to restart the service.

To server another website from nginx server(Reverse Proxy):

Need to add in /usr/local/nginx/conf/nginx.conf:

server {
        listen       80;
        server_name  localhost;

        location / {
	    proxy_pass http://localhost:8888/;
}

Nginx as LB:
Need to add in /usr/local/nginx/conf/nginx.conf:

http {
    upstream myapp1 {
        server srv1.example.com;
        server srv2.example.com;
        server srv3.example.com;
    }

    server {
        listen 80;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://myapp1;
        }
    }
}
