(1) web server config on centos.yml
     - copying proxy config using copy module. WebServer should have folder files. Inside that we keep proxy.conf
         - copy:
             src: proxy.conf
             dest: /etc/httpd/conf.d/proxy.conf
     
     - Download the default index file
             get_url:
               url:
               dest:
       
     - Restart service
               service:
                 name:
                 state: started
                 enabled: yes
    # config change will always need a restart 
           
             
        
(2) Handlers (09:00-17:30)
   What is Handler?
    ----Handlers are just like regular tasks in an Ansible playbook but are only run if the Task contains a notify directive
        and also indicates that it changed something. 
    ----For example, if a config file is changed, then the task referencing the config file templating operation may notify 
        a service restart handler. 
    ----This means services can be bounced only if they need to be restarted.
    ----Handlers can be used for things other than service restarts, but service restarts are the most common usage.
    ----It runs at the very ending of the task
    ----e.g. - name: Restart httpd
               service:
                name: httpd
                state: restarted
  (3) Intallation of App server (19:00-40:00)
      - download java
      - create application user by creating vars in appserver
      - user module-
           user:
             name: 
           
      - Unarchive module: this module can download the file and extract also. 
                        : the option needs to be specify is remote_src: yes
                       - name: Unarchive a file that needs to be downloaded (added in 2.0)
                         unarchive:
                             src: https://example.com/example.zip
                             dest: /usr/local/bin
                             remote_src: yes

      - become_user: 
        
  (4) Download WAR file & JDBC (40:00)     
  (5) Context.xml (45:00)
       -Default variables for role: Role default variables allow us to set default variables for included or dependent roles (see below).
                                  : To create defaults, simply add a defaults/main.yml file in your role directory. 
                                  : These variables will have the lowest priority of any variables available,
                                    and can be easily overridden by any other variable, including inventory variables.
  
  (6) Lineinfile ansible (52:46): When we want to add single line to the file
  
  (7) get_url module (54:00): to change the permission of while while downloading using mode. Using mode: ''
  
  (8) pre_reqs (01:01:00 - 01:14:00): sestatus to check SELinux status    
  
  (9)Ubuntu (01:15:00):
  
  Doubt:
  TOMCAT_VERSION in jenkins (30:00)
  Unable to download tomcat in jenkins
